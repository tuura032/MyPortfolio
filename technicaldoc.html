                        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. 
                        Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its 
                        environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language 
                        elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety 
                        of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                    </p>
                    <p><li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object 
                        Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond 
                        to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li></p>
                    <p>
                        <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. 
                        For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information 
                        from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                        </li>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A program, often referred to as source code or just code, is a set of special instructions to tell the computer 
                        what tasks to perform. Usually code is saved in a text file, although with JavaScript you can also type code directly 
                        into a developer console in a browser, which we'll cover shortly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rules for valid format and combinations of instructions is called a computer language, sometimes referred to as its 
                        syntax, much the same as English tells you how to spell words and how to create valid sentences using words and punctuation.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Statements
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        In a computer language, a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task is a statement. In JavaScript, 
                        a statement might look as follows:
                        
                        <pre>   a = b * 2;</pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The characters <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are called variables (see "Variables"), which are like simple boxes you can store 
                        any of your stuff in. In programs, variables hold values (like the number 42) to be used by the program. Think of them as symbolic 
                        placeholders for the values themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <code>=</code> and <code>*</code> characters are operators (see "Operators") -- they perform actions with the values and 
                        variables such as assignment and mathematic multiplication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The statement <code>a = b * 2;</code> tells the computer, roughly, to get the current value stored in the variable <code>b</code>, 
                        multiply that value by 2, then store the result back into another variable we call <code>a</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Programs are just collections of many such statements, which together describe all the steps that it takes to perform your 
                        program's purpose.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Expressions</h4>
                    <p>
                        Statements are made up of one or more expressions. An expression is any reference to a variable or value, or a set of variable(s) 
                        and value(s) combined with operators.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>  a = b * 2;</pre>
                    <p>
                        This statement has four expressions in it:
                    </p>

                    <li>2 is a literal value expression</li>
                    <li><code>b</code> is a variable expression, which means to retrieve its current value</li>
                    <li><code>b * 2</code> is an arithmetic expression, which means to do the multiplication</li>
                    <li><code>a = b * 2</code> is an assignment expression, which means to assign the result of the 
                        <code>b * 2</code> expression to the variable a (more on assignments later)</li><p></p>
                    <p>
                        A general expression that stands alone is also called an expression statement, such as the following:
                    </p>
                    <pre>   b * 2;</pre>
                    <p>This flavor of expression statement is not very common or useful, as generally it wouldn't have any effect on the running of the program -- 
                    it would retrieve the value of b and multiply it by 2, but then wouldn't do anything with that result.</p>
                    <p>A more common expression statement is a call expression statement (see "Functions"), as the entire statement is the function call expression 
                    itself:</p>
                    <pre>   alert( a );</pre>
                    <h4>Executing a Program</h4>
                    <p>
                        How do those collections of programming statements tell the computer what to do? The program needs to be executed, also referred to as running 
                        the program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Statements like <code>a = b * 2</code> are helpful for developers when reading and writing, but are not actually in a form the computer can directly 
                        understand. So a special utility on the computer (either an interpreter or a compiler) is used to translate the code you write into commands a computer can understand.
                    </p>
                    <p>For some computer languages, this translation of commands is typically done from top to bottom, line by line, every time the program is 
                    run, which is usually called interpreting the code.</p>
                    

                    <p>For other languages, the translation is done ahead of time, called compiling the code, so when the program runs later, what's running is 
                    actually the already compiled computer instructions ready to go.</p>

                    <p>It's typically asserted that JavaScript is interpreted, because your JavaScript source code is processed each time it's run. But that's 
                    not entirely accurate. The JavaScript engine actually compiles the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code.</p>

                    Operators

                <div class="line"></div>
                <article>
                    <p>Operators are how we perform actions on variables and values. We've already seen two JavaScript operators, the <code>=</code> and the <code>*</code>.

                    <p>The <code>*</code> operator performs mathematic multiplication. Simple enough, right?</p>
                        
                    <p>The <code>=</code> equals operator is used for assignment -- we first calculate the value on the right-hand side (source 
                        value) of the <code>=</code> and then put it into the variable that we specify on the left-hand side (target variable).</p>
                        
                    <p>Warning: This may seem like a strange reverse order to specify assignment. Instead of <code>a = 42</code>, some might 
                    prefer to flip the order so the source value is on the left and the target variable is on the right, like 
                    42 -> a (this is not valid JavaScript!). Unfortunately, the <code>a = 42</code> ordered form, and similar variations, 
                    is quite prevalent in modern programming languages. If it feels unnatural, just spend some time rehearsing 
                    that ordering in your mind to get accustomed to it.</p>
                    
                    <p>Consider:</p>
                    
                    <p><pre>   a = 2;
   b = a + 1;</pre></p>
                    <p>Here, we assign the 2 value to the a variable. Then, we get the value of the a variable (still 2), add 
                    1 to it resulting in the value 3, then store that value in the b variable.</p>
                    
                    <p>While not technically an operator, you'll need the keyword var in every program, as it's the primary way 
                    you declare (aka create) variables (see "Variables").</p>
                    
                    <p>You should always declare the variable by name before you use it. But you only need to declare a variable 
                    once for each scope (see "Scope"); it can be used as many times after that as needed. For example:</p>
                    
                    <pre>   var a = 20;
   a = a + 1;
   a = a * 2;

   console.log( a );	// 42</pre>

                    <p>Here are some of the most common operators in JavaScript:</p>
                    
                    <li>Assignment: <code>=</code> as in <code>a = 2.</code></li>
                    
                    <li>Math: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), and / (division), as in <code>a * 3</code>.</li>
                    
                    <li>Compound Assignment: +=, -=, *=, and /= are compound operators that combine a math operation with 
                    assignment, as in <code>a += 2</code> (same as <code>a = a + 2</code>).</li>
                    
                    <li>Increment/Decrement: ++ (increment), -- (decrement), as in a++ (similar to <code>a = a + 1</code>).</li>
                    
                    <li>Object Property Access: . as in console.log().</li>
                    
                    <li>Objects are values that hold other values at specific named locations called properties. obj.a means 
                    an object value called obj with a property of the name a. Properties can alternatively be accessed as obj["a"].</li> 
                    
                    <li>Equality: == (loose-equals), === (strict-equals), != (loose not-equals), !== (strict not-equals), as 
                    in a == b.</li>
                    
                    <li>Comparison: < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or loose-equals), >= (greater than or loose-equals), 
                    as in a <= b.</li>
                    
                    <li>>Logical: && (and), || (or), as in a || b that selects either a or b.</li>
                    
                    <li>These operators are used to express compound conditionals (see "Conditionals"), like if either a or b is true.</li>

                    Values & Types
                </h3>
                <div class="line"></div>
                <article>
                    <p>If you ask an employee at a phone store how much a certain phone costs, and they say "ninety-nine, ninety-nine" 
                    (i.e., $99.99), they're giving you an actual numeric dollar figure that represents what you'll need to pay (plus 
                    taxes) to buy it. If you want to buy two of those phones, you can easily do the mental math to double that value 
                    to get $199.98 for your base cost.</p>

                    <p>If that same employee picks up another similar phone but says it's "free" (perhaps with air quotes), they're not 
                    giving you a number, but instead another kind of representation of your expected cost ($0.00) -- the word "free."</p>
                    
                    <p>When you later ask if the phone includes a charger, that answer could only have been either "yes" or "no."</p>
                    
                    <p>In very similar ways, when you express values in a program, you choose different representations for those values 
                    based on what you plan to do with them.</p>
                    
                    <p>These different representations for values are called types in programming terminology. JavaScript has built-in 
                    types for each of these so called primitive values:</p>
                    
                    <li>When you need to do math, you want a number.</li>
                    <li>When you need to print a value on the screen, you need a string (one or more characters, words, sentences).</li>
                    <li>When you need to make a decision in your program, you need a boolean (true or false).</li>
                    <p>Values that are included directly in the source code are called literals. string literals are surrounded by 
                    double quotes "..." or single quotes ('...') -- the only difference is stylistic preference. number and boolean 
                    literals are just presented as is (i.e., 42, true, etc.).</p>
                    
                    <p>Consider:</p>
                    
                    <pre>   "I am a string";
   'I am also a string';

   42;

   true;
   false;</pre>
                    <p>Beyond string/number/boolean value types, it's common for programming languages to provide arrays, objects, 
                    functions, and more. We'll cover much more about values and types throughout this chapter and the next.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Converting Between Types</h4>
                    <p>If you have a number but need to print it on the screen, you need to convert the value to a string, and in 
                    JavaScript this conversion is called "coercion." Similarly, if someone enters a series of numeric characters 
                    into a form on an ecommerce page, that's a string, but if you need to then use that value to do math operations, 
                    you need to coerce it to a number.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p>JavaScript provides several different facilities for forcibly coercing between types. For example:</p>
                    
                    <pre>   var a = "42";
   var b = Number( a );
                    
   console.log( a );	// "42"
   console.log( b );	// 42</pre>
                    
                    <p>Using Number(..) (a built-in function) as shown is an explicit coercion from any other type to the number type. 
                    That should be pretty straightforward.</p>
                    
                    <p>But a controversial topic is what happens when you try to compare two values that are not already of the same type, 
                    which would require implicit coercion.</p>
                    
                    <p>When comparing the string "99.99" to the number 99.99, most people would agree they are equivalent. But they're not 
                    exactly the same, are they? It's the same value in two different representations, two different types. You could say 
                    they're "loosely equal," couldn't you?</p>
                    
                    <p>To help you out in these common situations, JavaScript will sometimes kick in and implicitly coerce values to the 
                    matching types.</p>
                    
                    <p>So if you use the == loose equals operator to make the comparison "99.99" == 99.99, JavaScript will convert the left-hand 
                    side "99.99" to its number equivalent 99.99. The comparison then becomes 99.99 == 99.99, which is of course true.</p>
                    
                    <p>While designed to help you, implicit coercion can create confusion if you haven't taken the time to learn the rules that 
                    govern its behavior. Most JS developers never have, so the common feeling is that implicit coercion is confusing and harms 
                    programs with unexpected bugs, and should thus be avoided. It's even sometimes called a flaw in the design of the language.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, implicit coercion is a mechanism that can be learned, and moreover should be learned by anyone wishing to take 
                    JavaScript programming seriously. Not only is it not confusing once you learn the rules, it can actually make your 
                    programs better! The effort is well worth it.</p>
